A new Educational mobile app.

## Getting Started

This app is useful to learn, program and practice your coding daily with up-to-date content. Explore the app library of coding courses and get help from our community of fellow code learners when you need it. Build code, master algorithms and data structures, create software focused on machine learning, learn to interpret design patterns, and compete in fun coding games against other developers.
